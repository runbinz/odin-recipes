        <h3>Make restaurant-worthy chicken katsu at home with this top-rated recipe. You won't believe how quickly it comes together with simple ingredients!</h3>
        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. 
            This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. 
            Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.
