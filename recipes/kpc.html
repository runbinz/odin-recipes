        <h3>This tasty kung pao chicken is similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. It's easy to make, 
            and you can be as creative with the measurements as you want. You can't go wrong! The sauce reduces until nice and thick.</h3>
        <p>This Kung Pao chicken recipe consists of cubed chicken breasts soaked in a marinade 
            (made with cornstarch, water, white wine, soy sauce, and sesame oil) and tossed in a sweet-savory sauce 
            (made with hot chili paste, brown sugar, white vinegar, water chestnuts, peanuts, onions, and garlic).
